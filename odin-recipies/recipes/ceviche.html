<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Ceviche is a delicious Peruvian dish that is can be served as an appetizer or a full meal. It is generally made from raw fresh fish or shrimp. The fish or shrimp marinates in lemon and/or lime citrus juices. The acidity in the citrus cures the fish causing it to become firm and opaque while absorbing flavor.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 lb. fresh skinless ocean fish fillets of your choice, cut into 1/2-inch dices</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice (or lemon juice)</li>
    <li>1 medium white onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 medium-large tomatoes, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 to 3 serranos (stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons fresh orange juice OR 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 large (or 2 small) ripe avocados (peeled, pitted, and diced)</li>
    <li>Tostadas (or whatever you prefer) for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Gather ingredients in a easy to reach area.</li>
    <li>In a 1 1/2-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime juice, and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Drain in a colander.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives, and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the orange juice or sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately.</li>
    <li>Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.
</ol>
